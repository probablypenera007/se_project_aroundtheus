### Plan on improving the project

With the knowledge that I gained from making this project it definitely gave me an idea of what it's like to work with a designer and follow instructions in a scale that i'm very unfamiliar with, as a foundation of this acquired skill I can see myself improving this project as a base in delivering my future clients required theme or vision.
